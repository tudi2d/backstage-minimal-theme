# [Backstage](https://backstage.io) | Minimal Theme Exploration

This is an exploration of a minimal theme for Backstage that tries to hide the complexity of the sidebar & colorful headers. It is inspired by the common information architecture of e.g. GitHub, Google or Vercel. Instead of having the company as the focus, it is aimed at creating a personalized experience for the logged-in user. For full personalization, a lot more work would be needed, but this can be seen as a small MVP to show how the feeling could be created just through theming.
